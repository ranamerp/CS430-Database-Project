# CS430-Database-Project
This was our project for CS430 where we had to create a database and a GUI to interface with it.
To install this using python, use pip and do "pip install -r requirements.txt. 

This project is not 100% stable. Due to my limited knowledge in QT, many things are not user-friendly. For example, you cannot use the Tab key or the Enter key when interacting with text boxes.
